# Arithmetic Coding for Protocol Buffers

This project is an exploration of using AI coding techniques, to implement arithmetic coding compression specifically for Protocol Buffers, and specialize the field models for Meshtastic packets.

This project is not guaranteed to work and is meant as a proof of concept, rather than an actual implementation.

This project implements arithmetic coding compression for Protocol Buffer messages in Go. It provides intelligent compression by building models based on protobuf message structure, with specialized handling for English text in string fields.
